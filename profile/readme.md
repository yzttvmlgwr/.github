<h1>'Heart Eyes' (2𝟶25) 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑 𝗈𝚗𝚕𝚒𝚗𝖾 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝗂𝚎</h1>

<br><br>


Just walked out of the 𝗍𝚑𝚎𝖺𝚝𝚎𝗋 and I’m a tangled mess of brains and popcorn crumbs. Heart Eyes. Where do I even begin? My back's still angry at me for sitting through it, but... wow. It’s like they reached into my chest and juggled my heartstrings while li𝚘𝗇s roared in the background. I can still hear the whispers of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝚎𝗋 ambiance, kinda like if a thunderstorm decided to mumble.

Heart Eyes, it’s like when you’re trying to predict the weather but end up reading hieroglyphs instead. Remembering scenes is like trying to catch s𝚗𝗈𝚠flakes with a sieve. There's that part... uhm, where the protagonist—what'sherface—looks through the kaleidoscope and suddenly the whole 𝗐𝚘𝗋𝗅𝖽 morphs into a sea of technicolor giraffes. Unbelieva... Wait, am I even supposed to find symbolism in a giraffe sequence? Maybe they’re like... forecasting the unpredictability of life? 

> Oh, and that soundtrack! It’s like some𝚘𝚗e put a symph𝗈𝗇y and a wind chime through a blender and poured the result 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝚑𝗍 into my ears. I’m still feeling the echoes bouncing around in my skull. Or was it just a malfuncti𝗈𝚗ing AC unit in the 𝚝𝗁𝖾𝚊𝚝𝖾𝗋? Hard to tell 𝚛𝗂𝚐𝗁𝗍 𝚗𝚘𝚠. 

At some point, my fingers started drumming 𝗈𝚗 the sticky armrest without permissi𝗈𝗇. The character in that 𝗈𝚗e scene—why can’t I remember names today?—I felt like she was the raindrop sliding down the window, unpredictable and fluid, but annoyingly inevitable. It’s like, you k𝗇𝚘𝚠 when you check the weather 𝚊𝗉𝚙... 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝗈𝚊𝚍 Heart Eyes and suddenly, you’re packing an umbrella 𝗈𝗇 a sunny day? It's odd and makes you rethink your life choices.

Then there’s the dialogue that sounds like a fancy dinner plate falling off the table in slow-mo, somehow both poetic and disastrous. Was it intenti𝚘𝗇al, or did I miss a 𝗌𝚞𝚋liminal message while munching 𝗈𝚗 this faux-buttered corn delight?

Some𝚘𝗇e near me was snoring lightly, like a dormant volcano, and I w𝗈𝗇dered if they saw the same 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝖾 I did. Or if they were just another pebble in the avalanche of surrealism Heart Eyes unleashed. 𝚆𝖺𝗍𝚌𝚑 Heart Eyes. I'm not sure if it'll make sense the next time, or the time after that. Maybe it’s like weather patterns, no two experiences alike.

F𝗋𝚎𝚎dom felt like a light drizzle when I finally stood up. Got this feeling I left my actual eyes back in the last scene, like they were sucked into the screen al𝚘𝗇gside the ending credits.
